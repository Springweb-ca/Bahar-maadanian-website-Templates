      The article How to become a video game designer promotes the idea that
      anyone can participate in the creation of such games with certain
      qualifications. The games and computer graphics industry itself is
      multidisciplinary and offers many opportunities for creativity and
      innovation. Having interest, love and involvement in the video games
      themselves from the userâ€™s point of view already endows such a person with
      a number of qualifications that allow him to participate in the creation
      of games in the future, with the proper education and, if possible, the
      desire for perfectionism.
