      C may be defined as a programming language made up of commands,
      procedures, and constants. For starters, this language is easily
      expandable, allowing for the addition of new functionality. It supports
      pointers, and it is an adaptable programming language that can quickly
      take on new features. Given that C is so portable, one is able to write
      software that runs on a variety of systems with minimal or zero
      modifications. Practically every programming language is now implemented
      in C; therefore, understanding C is essentially a great opportunity to
      learn them (Coding Ninjas). However, there is no runtime verification
      mechanism in this language, which may be considered a drawback. Moreover,
      it does not support OOP, which is why C++ was invented.
